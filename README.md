# workflows

This repo contains [reusable workflows for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows). We use this repo to standardize our workflows.

These files use the [workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

## `dockerimage`

Notes and example use coming soon...
